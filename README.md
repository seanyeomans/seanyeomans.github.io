## üì± Responsive Design

The website is fully responsive with breakpoints:
- **Mobile**: < 768px
- **Tablet**: 768px - 1024px
- **Desktop**: > 1024px

## üîß Available Scripts

- `npm run build` - Builds the app for production
- `npm test` - Launches the test runner
- `npm run eject` - Ejects from Create React App (not recommended)

## üöÄ Performance Optimization

The website includes several performance optimizations:
- **Code Splitting**: Automatic code splitting by Create React App
- **Lazy Loading**: Images and components load as needed
- **Minification**: Production builds are minified
- **Caching**: Static assets are cached for better performance
- **Optimized Images**: Images are optimized for web delivery

## üîí Security Considerations

- **Environment Variables**: Sensitive data should be stored in `.env` files
- **HTTPS**: Always deploy with HTTPS enabled
- **Content Security Policy**: Consider adding CSP headers
- **Dependencies**: Regularly update dependencies for security patches

## üìä Analytics Integration

To add analytics (Google Analytics, etc.):

2. **Or use React Helmet** for dynamic meta tags
3. **Configure environment variables** for different environments

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Port already in use**: Server will automatically try port 3001, 3002, etc.
2. **Build errors**: Check terminal output for specific error messages
3. **Dependencies missing**: Run `npm install` again
4. **Styling issues**: Ensure Tailwind CSS is properly configured

### Development Tips
